Cafe Rewards Offers

Data that simulates the behavior of Cafe Rewards members over a 30-day period, including their transactions and responses to promotional offers.

Customers receive offers once every few days and have a limited time to redeem them. These can be informational offers (simple advertisement of a product), discount offers, or "buy one, get one" (BOGO) offers. Each customer receives a different mix of offers, attempting to maximize their probability of making a purchase.

Every customer purchase during the period is marked as a transaction. For a transaction to be attributed to an offer, it must occur at the same time as when the offer was "completed" by the customer.

I can confirm that all customers in the events file are indeed present in the customers file.
